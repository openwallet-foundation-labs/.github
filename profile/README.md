# Overview

The OWF is a consortium of companies and non-profit organisations collaborating
to drive global adoption of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet
solutions as well as providing access to expertise and advice through our
Government Advisory Council.

The OWF aims to set best practices for digital wallet technology through
collaboration on standards-based OSS components that issuers, wallet providers
and relying parties can use to bootstrap implementations that preserve user
choice, security and privacy.

The `openwallet-foundation-labs` organization is intended to hold all [OpenWallet Foundation Labs](https://openwallet-foundation.github.io/tac/governance/project-lifecycle/#labs).

**Definition** 

Labs are those which the TAC believes are, or have the potential to be, important to the ecosystem of Technical Projects or the open wallet ecosystem as a whole. They may be early-stage code just getting started, or they may be long-established projects with minimal resource needs. The Labs stage provides a beneficial, neutral home for these projects in order to foster collaborative development and provide a path to deeper alignment with other OpenWallet Foundation projects via the project lifecycle process.

**Examples**

1. Experimental code that is designed to extend one or more OpenWallet Foundation projects with functionality or interoperability libraries. 
1. Independent code that fits within the Foundation's mission and provides potential to meet an unfulfilled need.
1. Code commissioned or sanctioned by the OpenWallet Foundation.
1. Any code that intends to join the Growth or later stages in the future and wishes to lay the foundation for that transition.

**Expectations**

End users should evaluate Labs with care, as this stage does not set requirements for community size, governance, or production readiness. Labs will receive minimal support from the Foundation. Labs will be reviewed on an annual basis; they may also request a status review by submitting a report to the TAC.

**Acceptance Criteria**

To be considered for the Labs Stage, the project must meet the following requirements:

* Submit a [project proposal](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/project-proposals#instructions-for-proposing-a-project) with a Preferred Maturity Level of `Labs`.
* Document an intellectual property policy that leverages the Apache 2.0 license or an open license that has been approved by the OpenWallet Foundation's Governing Board.
* In the case of existing projects, an agreement to transfer the project name, trademarks, and electronic account assets (github repo, social media accounts, domain names, etc.) to Linux Foundation Europe for the benefit of the OpenWallet Foundation.
* Upon acceptance, Labs must list their status prominently on their website/README (e.g., PROJECT, an OpenWallet Foundation Lab).
